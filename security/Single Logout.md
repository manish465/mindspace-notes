- Single Logout is a feature that allows a user to log out once from any of the applications within the [[Single Sign-On]] environment, and subsequently, all active sessions across all linked applications are terminated simultaneously. This ensures that the user's access is effectively revoked from all the applications, providing an added layer of security and user convenience.
