1. Bean Management: The Spring container is responsible for creating, instantiating, and managing Spring beans. Spring beans are Java objects that are initialized, configured, and maintained by the Spring container.
    
2. Dependency Injection: The Spring container performs dependency injection, allowing it to inject required dependencies into beans during their instantiation. This eliminates the need for objects to create their dependencies, promoting a more flexible and maintainable design.
    
3. Bean Scopes: The Spring container supports different bean scopes, such as singleton, prototype, request, session, etc. These scopes define how many instances of a bean are created and how long they live.
    
4. Configuration Metadata: The Spring container relies on configuration metadata, typically provided in XML, Java annotations, or Java configuration classes. This metadata instructs the container on how to create and configure beans.
    
5. AOP Integration: The Spring container integrates with Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) to provide additional functionalities, such as method interception and cross-cutting concerns.
    
6. Bean Post-Processors: The container can apply BeanPostProcessors, which are special beans that can customize or modify other beans during their initialization or before destruction.
