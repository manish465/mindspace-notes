Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a [[programming paradigm]] that complements the traditional object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm.

It aims to address [[cross-cutting concerns]], which are behaviors or functionalities that are scattered across different modules or components in a software application.

Cross-cutting concerns often include logging, security, transaction management, error handling, caching, and more.

In OOP, a program is organized into classes and objects, where each class represents a specific entity, and objects encapsulate the data and behavior related to that entity. 

However, when dealing with cross-cutting concerns, the related code tends to be duplicated or tangled throughout various classes, making the codebase harder to maintain and understand.

Aspect-Oriented Programming introduces the concept of aspects, which are modules that encapsulate cross-cutting concerns separately from the main application logic.

Aspects can be seen as reusable "advice" that can be applied to multiple parts of the application, enhancing code modularity and promoting separation of concerns.
