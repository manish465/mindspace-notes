- Annotations are a form of metadata that can be added to Java code to provide additional information about the code to compilers, runtime environments, frameworks, or other tools.
- Annotations are defined using the `@` symbol followed by the annotation name, and they can be applied to various elements of Java code, such as classes, methods, fields, and parameters.
