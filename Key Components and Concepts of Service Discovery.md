1. Service Registry: The service registry is a centralized or distributed database that maintains the metadata and information about all the available services in the system. It acts as a repository where services can register themselves with their network location and other relevant details.
    
2. Service Registration: Each service, when it starts up or becomes available, registers itself with the service registry by providing information such as its name, IP address, port, and any other necessary metadata.
    
3. Service Discovery Client: Clients, typically other services or applications, that need to interact with specific services use a service discovery client to query the service registry and discover the locations of the desired services.
    
4. Dynamic Updates: Service discovery enables dynamic updates of service information. When a service becomes unavailable or goes offline, it can deregister itself from the service registry. Similarly, when new services come online, they can register themselves.
    
5. Load Balancing: Service discovery can be combined with load balancing techniques. The client can retrieve multiple instances of the same service from the registry and use load balancing algorithms to distribute requests among them.
    
6. High Availability: Service discovery helps maintain high availability, as it allows clients to adapt and find alternative services if the original ones become unavailable.
