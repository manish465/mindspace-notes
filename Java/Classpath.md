The classpath is a parameter that specifies the locations where the JVM looks for class files and resources during runtime. It is a list of directories and JAR files that contain the compiled bytecode of Java classes and any associated resources, such as [[Configuration]] files, properties files, XML files, etc.

### It can be manually set by using this command in terminal:

```shell
java -cp /path/to/myclasses:/path/to/mylib.jar MyApp
```
