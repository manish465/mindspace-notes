In Java, an interface is a reference type that defines a contract or a set of abstract methods that classes implementing the interface must adhere to. It is a mechanism used to achieve abstraction and define a common set of behaviors that multiple classes can implement independently.

An interface is declared using the `interface` keyword, and it contains method signatures (without method bodies) and, optionally, constants. All methods in an interface are implicitly public and abstract, meaning they have no implementation and must be overridden by classes that implement the interface.

#Example :


```Java
public interface MyInterface {
    // Method signatures (no method bodies)
    void method1();
    void method2();

    // Constants (implicitly static and final)
    int CONSTANT_VALUE = 10;
}
```
