- Request Routing : The API Gateway handles incoming client requests and routes them to the appropriate backend services based on the request URL or other criteria. It abstracts the underlying microservices from clients, making it easier to manage and evolve the backend architecture.

- [[Load Balancing]] : An [[API Gateway]] can distribute incoming client requests across multiple instances of backend services to ensure optimal resource utilization and better performance.

- Security : The [[API Gateway]] can enforce security mechanisms such as [[authentication]], [[authorization]], and [[access control]]. It can also handle SSL/TLS termination to offload encryption/decryption from the backend services.

- Rate Limiting and Throttling : An [[API Gateway]] can apply rate limiting and throttling to control the number of [[Request]] clients can make within a specific timeframe, preventing abuse and ensuring fair usage of resources.

- Request and Response Transformation : The [[API Gateway]] can modify [[Request]] and [[Response]] payloads, converting between different data formats or aggregating data from multiple backend services into a single response.

- Caching : An [[API Gateway]] can cache [[Response]] from backend services to reduce the load on the backend and improve response times for frequently requested data.

- Logging and Monitoring : The [[API Gateway]] can collect logs and metrics related to API usage and performance, providing valuable insights into the system's behavior.
