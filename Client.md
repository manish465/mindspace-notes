In the context of computer networking and distributed systems, a client is a piece of software or a device that initiates a [[request]] for services or resources from another program or server.

Examples of Clients:

- Web Browsers: Web browsers (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox) act as clients when users [[request]] web pages or resources from web servers.
   
- Email Clients: Email clients (e.g., Microsoft Outlook, Gmail) are used to access and manage emails from email servers.
   
- Mobile Apps: Mobile applications running on smartphones or tablets often act as clients, interacting with server-side services to fetch data or perform actions.
   
- File Transfer Clients: File transfer clients (e.g., FileZilla, WinSCP) initiate requests to file servers to upload or download files.
   
- Database Clients: Database clients (e.g., SQL clients) send queries to database servers to retrieve or modify data.
  
- IoT Devices: Internet of Things (IoT) devices can act as clients, communicating with remote servers to exchange data and receive commands.
