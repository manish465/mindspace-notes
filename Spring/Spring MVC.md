Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a web framework provided by the Spring Framework for building web applications in Java.

It follows the MVC architectural pattern, which separates an application into three interconnected components.

1. [[Model|Model]] : Represents the application's data and business logic. It encapsulates the data and provides methods to manipulate and process it.
    
2. [[Views and Templates|View]] : Represents the presentation layer of the application. It defines how the data is displayed to the user, typically in the form of HTML, XML, or other markup languages.
    
3. [[Controllers|Controller]] : Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It handles incoming requests from the user, processes them, interacts with the Model to fetch or update data, and then selects the appropriate View to display the response.
