1. Aspect: An aspect is a modular unit that encapsulates a cross-cutting concern. It defines a specific behavior that should be applied to various parts of the codebase.
   
2. Pointcut: A pointcut is a specification that defines where an aspect should be applied in the codebase. It identifies specific join points (places in the code) where the aspect's behavior should be injected.
   
3. Advice: Advice is the actual implementation of what should happen at the specified join points. It represents the cross-cutting concern's logic and is executed at the appropriate points during the application's execution.
  
4. Join Points: Join points are specific points in the codebase where aspects can be applied. For example, method execution, method call, field access, and exception handling are all join points.
   
5. Weaving: Weaving is the process of applying aspects to the appropriate join points in the codebase. It can be done during compile-time (static weaving), load-time (dynamic weaving), or at runtime (aspectj runtime weaving).
