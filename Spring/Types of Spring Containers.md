1. BeanFactory: The BeanFactory is the basic form of the Spring container. It provides basic support for bean instantiation, dependency injection, and bean lifecycle management. However, it is considered a lightweight container with lazy bean initialization.
    
2. ApplicationContext: The ApplicationContext is an advanced version of the Spring container and extends the BeanFactory. It adds additional features like internationalization, event propagation, and resource handling. It is the preferred container for most Spring applications as it provides more functionality and is more feature-rich.
