- Auto-configuration : [[Spring Boot]] automatically configures various [[Component]] based on the [[Dependencies]] it detects in the [[Classpath]]. It eliminates the need for explicit [[Configuration]], reducing development time and effort.

- Starter dependencies : [[Spring Boot]] provides a set of "starter" [[Dependencies]] that include all the necessary [[Dependencies]] for specific functionality. These starters make it easy to add common features like web applications, security, database access, messaging, and more, by simply including the appropriate starter [[Dependencies|dependency]] in your project.

- Embedded server : [[Spring Boot]] includes an [[embedded servlet container]] (such as [[Tomcat]], [[Jetty]], or [[Undertow]]) that allows you to run your application as a standalone executable JAR file. You don't need to deploy your application to an external server, simplifying deployment and distribution.

- Cloud-native support : [[Spring Boot]] integrates well with cloud-native technologies and platforms. It includes features for building cloud-ready applications, such as Auto-configuration for cloud services, [[Distributed Tracing]], [[Service Discovery]],  [[Configuration Management]], [[Load Balancing]] and [[API Gateway]]
