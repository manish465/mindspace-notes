1. Centralized Configuration Server: Spring Cloud Config provides a centralized configuration server that acts as a repository for storing configuration properties for various microservices. It allows you to store configurations in various formats, such as YAML, JSON, or properties files.
  
2. Configurable Profiles: Spring Cloud Config supports the use of profiles to manage different sets of configuration properties for different environments (e.g., development, testing, production). Each microservice can specify which profile(s) it should use.
  
3. Dynamic Property Refresh: Spring Cloud Config provides a mechanism for refreshing configuration properties dynamically without requiring a full application restart. This allows you to update configurations in real-time without disrupting the running application.

4. Externalized Configuration: With Spring Cloud Config, you can externalize configuration properties, reducing the need for hardcoding values within the application code. This promotes a more modular and maintainable design.
  
5. Environment Variables and Consul Property Source: Spring Cloud allows you to use environment variables and other external property sources (e.g., Consul, etcd) for configuration management, making it flexible and compatible with various deployment environments.
  
6. Hierarchical Configuration: Spring Cloud Config supports hierarchical configuration, where specific properties can be shared among multiple services or overridden for individual services.
  
7. Decryption and Encryption: Spring Cloud Config provides support for encrypting sensitive configuration properties to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.
