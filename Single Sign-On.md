- SSO is a process that allows a user to log in once and gain access to multiple applications or services without the need to re-enter their credentials for each one.
- In traditional authentication systems, users have to provide their username and password separately for each application they want to use, which can be cumbersome and increases the risk of password fatigue or weak password usage.
- With SSO, a user logs in once to a central authentication system (often referred to as the Identity Provider or IdP). After successful authentication, the IdP generates a security token (like a session token or JSON Web Token) that confirms the user's identity.
- This token is then used to authenticate the user across other applications or services (called Service Providers or SPs) within the same SSO environment.
- The advantages of SSO include improved user convenience, reduced password fatigue, enhanced security through centralized authentication and management, and easier user onboarding and offboarding processes.
