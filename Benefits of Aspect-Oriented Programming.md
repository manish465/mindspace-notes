1. Separation of Concerns: AOP helps in separating cross-cutting concerns from the main application logic, improving code maintainability and readability.
   
2. Reusability: Aspects can be reused across multiple parts of the codebase, promoting code reuse and modularity.
  
3. Improved Modularity: AOP enables better organization of code by keeping cross-cutting concerns isolated in aspects.
   
4. Flexibility: AOP allows you to modify the behavior of an application without changing its core logic, making it easier to adapt to changing requirements.
