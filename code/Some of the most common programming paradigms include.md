1. Imperative Programming: In this paradigm, the focus is on specifying the sequence of operations to be performed by the computer. It uses statements and commands that explicitly change the program's state. Examples of imperative programming languages include C, C++, and Python.

2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): OOP is based on the concept of "objects," which are instances of classes representing real-world entities or data structures. It emphasizes encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Languages like Java, C#, and Python have strong support for OOP.
  
3. Functional Programming: Functional programming treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. It relies heavily on immutability, pure functions (with no side effects), and higher-order functions. Functional programming languages include Haskell, Lisp, and Scala.

4. Declarative Programming: In this paradigm, the focus is on specifying the "what" rather than the "how." The programmer describes the desired result, and the language takes care of the underlying details. SQL is a common example of declarative programming.
  
5. Procedural Programming: Procedural programming focuses on the procedures or routines that carry out specific tasks. It is similar to imperative programming but emphasizes dividing the code into reusable procedures or functions. Languages like C and Pascal use procedural programming.
  
6. Event-Driven Programming: This paradigm is centered around reacting to events or user actions. It often involves setting up event handlers or callbacks to respond to various events. Event-driven programming is commonly used in graphical user interfaces and web development.
   
7. Logic Programming: In logic programming, programs are constructed as a set of logical statements and rules. The system uses logical inference to derive conclusions based on these rules. Prolog is a well-known logic programming language.
   
8. Concurrent and Parallel Programming: These paradigms focus on managing and coordinating multiple tasks or processes to execute simultaneously. They are essential for efficient utilization of multicore processors and distributed systems.
