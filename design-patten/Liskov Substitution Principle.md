It defines a concept related to inheritance and subtyping and is an important guideline for designing and using classes and object in a way that ensures proper behavior or derived class.

The Liskov Substitution Principle states:

"Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program."

In simpler terms, if a class is a subtype (i.e., a derived or child class) of a base class, it should be able to replace the base class without affecting the correctness of the program. This principle ensures that inheritance relationships are well-defined and that derived classes extend or specialize the behavior of the base class in a consistent manner.

[[Here is a simple example in Java to illustrate the Liskov Substitution Principle]]
