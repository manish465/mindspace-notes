```Java
// This is a monolithic interface that violates the ISP.
interface Worker {
    void work();
    void eat();
    void sleep();
}

class Programmer implements Worker {
    public void work() {
        // Code for programming work.
    }

    public void eat() {
        // Code for eating.
    }

    public void sleep() {
        // Code for sleeping.
    }
}

class Manager implements Worker {
    public void work() {
        // Code for managerial work.
    }

    public void eat() {
        // Code for eating.
    }

    public void sleep() {
        // Code for sleeping.
    }
}
```

In the example above, the `Worker` interface includes three methods: `work`, `eat`, and `sleep`. Both the `Programmer` and `Manager` classes must implement all of these methods, even though they have different responsibilities. This design violates the Interface Segregation Principle because clients (in this case, the `Programmer` and `Manager` classes) are forced to depend on methods that are irrelevant to their roles.

To adhere to the ISP, we should create more specialized interfaces, each focusing on a specific aspect of behavior:

```Java
interface Workable {
    void work();
}

interface Eatable {
    void eat();
}

interface Sleepable {
    void sleep();
}

class Programmer implements Workable, Eatable {
    public void work() {
        // Code for programming work.
    }

    public void eat() {
        // Code for eating.
    }
}

class Manager implements Workable, Sleepable {
    public void work() {
        // Code for managerial work.
    }

    public void sleep() {
        // Code for sleeping.
    }
}
```

Now, the `Programmer` and `Manager` classes implement only the interfaces and methods relevant to their specific responsibilities. This adheres to the Interface Segregation Principle and promotes more maintainable and flexible code, as clients are not burdened with irrelevant methods from the interface.
