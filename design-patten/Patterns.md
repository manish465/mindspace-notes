**Creational Patterns:**

- **[[Singleton]]:** Guarantees one and only one instance of a class exists.
- **[[Factory Method]]:** Creates objects without specifying the exact class to be created.
- **[[Abstract Factory]]:** Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **[[Prototype]]:** Creates new objects by copying existing ones.
- **[[Builder]]:** Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.

**Structural Patterns:**

- **[[Adapter]]:** Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
- **[[Decorator]]:** Adds functionality to an object dynamically.
- **[[Facade]]:** Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.
- **[[Composite]]:** Treats a group of objects as a single object.
- **[[Proxy]]:** Provides controlled access to an object.

**Behavioral Patterns:**

- **[[Observer]]:** Allows objects to be notified of changes in another object.
- **[[Strategy]]:** Allows changing an algorithm's implementation without changing the client.
- **[[Template Method]]:** Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass, but allows subclasses to provide the implementation steps.
- **[[Iterator]]:** Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially.
- **[[Command]]:** Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization, queuing, and undo/redo.
- **[[State]]:** Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- **[[Chain of Responsibility]]:** Passes a request through a chain of objects to find the one that can handle it.

**Other patterns:**

- **[[MVC]] (Model-View-Controller):** Separates the application into three parts: model, view, and controller.
- **[[MVP]] (Model-View-Presenter):** Similar to MVC, but the presenter acts as an intermediary between the model and view.
