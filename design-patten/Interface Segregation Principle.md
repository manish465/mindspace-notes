Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use

In simpler terms, it suggests that an interface should have a specific, well-defined purpose, and clients that implement the interface should not be required to implement methods that are irrelevant to their particular needs.

In essence, it encourages the creation of smaller and more specialized interfaces rather than a single, all-encompassing interface.

[[Here is an example in Java to illustrate the Interface Segregation Principle]]
