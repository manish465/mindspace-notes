It states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

In other words, once a class is or module is written and working correctly, it should not be altered to add new functionality or change existing behavior. Instead, the software should be designed in a way that allows you to extend its capabilities without modifying the existing code. This principle promotes code reusability and minimizes the risk of introducing new bugs when making changes.

[[Here is an example to illustrate the Open and Closed Principle]]
