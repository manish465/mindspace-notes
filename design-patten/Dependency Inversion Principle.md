Class should depend on interface rather then concreate class

The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design, and it is focused on reducing the coupling between high-level and low-level modules in software systems.

The DIP helps promote flexibility, maintainability, and the ability to change the components of a system without affecting other parts of the system.

The Dependency Inversion Principle consists of two main principles:

1. [[High-Level Modules Should Not Depend on Low-Level Modules]]
2. [[Abstractions Should Not Depend on Details]]

[[Here's an example in Java to illustrate the Dependency Inversion Principle]]
