With the rise of Java [[Annotations]], Spring introduced support for annotation-based configuration. Annotations, such as `@Component`, `@Autowired`, and `@Qualifier`, are used to mark classes as components, specify dependencies, and resolve conflicts. [[Spring Framework]] automatically scans the [[Classpath]] for annotated components and performs the [[Component Wiring]] based on the specified [[Annotations]].
