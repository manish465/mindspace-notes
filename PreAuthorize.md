`@PreAuthorize` is an [[annotation]] used in [[Spring Security]] to specify [[access control]] rules for method invocations. It allows you to specify expressions that determine whether a method can be invoked or not based on the user’s role, the arguments passed to the method, and other factors. This is known as expression-based access control.
