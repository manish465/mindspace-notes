Dependency Injection (DI) is a [[design pattern]] used in software engineering and [[object-oriented programming]] to achieve [[loose coupling]] between classes and [[Component]]. It is a form of [[inversion of control]], where the responsibility of creating and providing [[Dependencies]] is shifted from the dependent class to an external entity (typically, a framework or a container).

In simpler terms, Dependency Injection allows a class (the dependent) to receive its required [[dependencies]] (other objects or services) from an external source, rather than creating them itself. This approach promotes modularity, testability, and maintainability in the codebase.
