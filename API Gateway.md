An API Gateway is a server that acts as an intermediary between [[Client]]s and [[Backend Service]]s in a [[microservices]]-based or distributed architecture.

It provides a single entry point for external clients to access various APIs and services within the system. The primary purpose of an API Gateway is to centralize and manage all the incoming API requests, providing a unified interface for clients to interact with the backend services.
