Distributed tracing is a technique used in [[distributed systems]] to monitor and analyze the flow of requests as they traverse multiple [[Microservices]] or components to fulfill a single user transaction or operation. It provides insights into the end-to-end journey of a request, helping developers and operations teams understand the interactions and dependencies between various services in a distributed architecture.

The process of distributed tracing involves the following steps:

- Instrumentation: Developers add tracing code to the [[Microservices]] or [[Component]] to capture tracing information. This code generates spans and ensures that each span carries the same trace ID to link related operations.

-  Trace Propagation: As a [[Request]] travels through the system, the trace ID is propagated from one component to another. Each component appends its span to the existing trace.

- Centralized Collection: The trace data from all the [[Services Layer]] is collected and sent to a centralized tracing system, often referred to as the Tracing Backend. This system stores and manages the trace data.

- Visualization and Analysis: The tracing backend provides tools and [[Interface]] to visualize and analyze the trace data. This allows developers and operations teams to understand the [[Request]] flow, identify bottlenecks, and troubleshoot performance issues across the distributed system.
