- Simplified Client Access: Clients interact with a single entry point (the [[API Gateway]]), abstracting the complexities of the underlying [[Microservices]] and providing a consistent interface.
   
- Centralized Management: An [[API Gateway]] allows for centralized management of various aspects, such as security, rate limiting, and monitoring, for all API endpoints.
   
- Improved Scalability: [[API Gateway]] can distribute requests across multiple backend instances, facilitating horizontal scalability for the system.
   
- Better Performance: By applying caching and load balancing, an [[API Gateway]] can optimize response times and resource utilization.
   
- Enhanced Security: [[API Gateway]] act as a security layer, enforcing authentication and authorization policies to protect backend services.
