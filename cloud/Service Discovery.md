Service discovery is a mechanism used in distributed systems to dynamically locate and identify available services within the network.

In a microservices architecture or any distributed system, services often come and go due to scaling, deployments, or failures.

Service discovery allows applications and services to find and communicate with each other without hardcoding IP addresses or endpoints, making the system more resilient and flexible.
