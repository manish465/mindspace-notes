- Service Independence: Each microservice is a self-contained unit that operates independently of other services. It can be developed, deployed, and managed by a dedicated team, which promotes a decentralized and agile development approach.
   
- Single Responsibility: Each microservice is responsible for a single, well-defined business capability or function. This promotes a clear separation of concerns and makes the services more maintainable and easier to reason about.
   
- Loosely Coupled: Microservices communicate with each other through well-defined APIs or protocols. They are loosely coupled, meaning changes to one service do not directly affect others, enhancing flexibility and allowing each service to evolve independently.
   
- Independent Deployment: Microservices can be deployed independently of each other. This enables continuous deployment and allows for faster updates and releases, as changes to one service don't require redeployment of the entire application.
   
- Technology Diversity: Microservices architecture allows each service to be developed using the most suitable technology stack for its specific requirements. This promotes polyglot programming and technology diversity within the organization.
   
- Scalability: Services can be scaled independently based on demand, allowing organizations to allocate resources efficiently and handle varying workloads effectively.
