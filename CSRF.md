CSRF stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery, also known as XSRF. It is a type of security vulnerability that allows attackers to trick authenticated users into unknowingly executing unwanted actions on a web application.

In a CSRF attack, the attacker crafts a malicious request and tries to get the victim's browser to execute it. This is achieved by tricking the victim into clicking on a link or visiting a website that contains the malicious request. If the victim is already authenticated in the target web application, the browser automatically includes the user's authentication credentials (cookies) in the request, making it appear as if the legitimate user initiated the action.
